\usage{
fit_expression_model_with_gp(
  Y,
  group,
  graph,
  pname,
  pgenes,
  ncores,
  method = c("ridge", "lasso", "lm"),
  pgene_parent_set = c("all", "non_signature", "hub_only")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{Y}{A numeric matrix of expression data (cells x genes), including the hub node.}

\item{group}{A character or factor vector indicating the group for each cell in Y.}

\item{graph}{An igraph object representing the full regulatory structure.}

\item{pname}{A character string for the name of the hub node (e.g., "PC1").}

\item{pgenes}{A character vector of the signature genes regulated by the hub.}

\item{ncores}{The number of cores for parallel computation.}

\item{method}{The regression method for the main B matrix. One of 'lm', 'lasso', or 'ridge'.}

\item{pgene_parent_set}{A character string specifying the allowed set of
regulators for signature genes. One of 'all', 'non_signature', or 'hub_only'.}
}
\value{
A list with two components:
  \item{B_matrix}{The main regulatory matrix (sources x targets).}
  \item{switch_coefficients}{A list where each element is the named coefficient
    vector from the univariate regression of the hub against one of its parents.}
}
\description{
This function prepares the two key components needed for the sophisticated
hybrid prediction model. It leverages the standard \code{\link{fit_expression_model}}
to learn the main linear propagator (B matrix) after applying specific graph
modifications, and separately learns the robust, univariate "switch"
coefficients for the hub's triggers.
