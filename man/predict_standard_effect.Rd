\title{Predict Standard Perturbation Effect (Delta)}
\usage{
predict_standard_effect(B, ko_expressions, wt_expressions, max_dist = Inf)
}
\arguments{
\item{B}{A numeric matrix of regulatory coefficients where rows are sources
('Intercept' and genes) and columns are targets (genes). This is the output
of \code{\link{fit_expression_model}}.}

\item{ko_expressions}{A named numeric vector of the expression levels for the
perturbed genes (e.g., 0 for a full knockout).}

\item{wt_expressions}{A named numeric vector of the wild-type expression levels
for each gene.}

\item{max_dist}{The maximum distance from the KO gene for an effect to be
propagated. Distances are calculated on the functional graph derived from B.
Default is `Inf` (full propagation).}
}
\value{
A numeric matrix of predicted delta values (rows are KOs, columns are genes).
}
\description{
Predicts the perturbation effect (delta from wild-type) for a set of KOs
by propagating the initial perturbation through the network structure defined
by the non-zero coefficients in B.
