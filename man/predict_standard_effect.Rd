\title{Predict Standard Perturbation Effect (Delta)}
\usage{
predict_standard_effect(
  B,
  ko_expressions,
  wt_expressions,
  graph = NULL,
  max_dist = Inf
)
}
\arguments{
\item{B}{A numeric matrix of regulatory coefficients where rows are sources
('Intercept' and genes) and columns are targets (genes). This is the output
of \code{\link{fit_expression_model}}.}

\item{ko_expressions}{A named numeric vector of the expression levels for the
perturbed genes (e.g., 0 for a full knockout).}

\item{wt_expressions}{A named numeric vector of the wild-type expression levels
for each gene.}

\item{graph}{An optional igraph object. If NULL (default), a functional graph is
derived from B. If provided, this "roadmap" graph is used for distance
calculations.}

\item{max_dist}{The maximum distance from the KO gene for an effect to be
propagated. Default is `Inf` (full propagation).}
}
\value{
A numeric matrix of predicted delta values (rows are KOs, columns are genes).
}
\description{
Predicts the perturbation effect (delta from wild-type) for a set of KOs
by propagating the initial perturbation through the network structure.
